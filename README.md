# Path Finding in Kelowna Downtown Using Search Algorithms

We will implement two search algorithms: 1) Dijkstra's algorithm, and 2) A* search algorithm to find the shortest path on the map of downtown in Kelowna, Canada. 

Following the steps in the notebook of "Kelowna_graph_search.ipynb", you can get the same path using two different algorithms.

Path found by A* or Dijkstra's algorithms:
